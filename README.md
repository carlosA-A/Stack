# Stack

Given a segment of the source code, your C++ code should analyze the code and
extract all tokens, which include:

  - Keywords: keywords are the words reserved by the language. They are all uppercase.

  - In our language, we have only three keywords ”BEGIN”, ”END” and ”FOR”.

  - Identifiers: An identifier is used to describe the variables, which are all lower-case.

  - Only letters ’a’-’z’ are legal in an identifier.

  - Constants: Numbers like 10 ... No negative numbers.

  - Operators: all arithmetic operations (i.e., +, -, *, and /), ”++” and ”=”

  - Delimiters: like ”,” and ”;”
